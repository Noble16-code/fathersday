        <p>Dear Dad,</p>
        <p>
            From teaching us how to ride a bike to helping us as we grow up, you've always been there. 
            Your love, guidance, and wisdom have shaped who we are today. We can't thank you enough for all the 
            sacrifices you've made and the love you've given us.You will reap the fruit of your labor when we are old enough to use the knowledge you instilled in us in the world. You are our hero!
        </p>
